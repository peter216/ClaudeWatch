"""
claude-watchdog: PreToolUse hook for Claude Code

Generic rule engine that enforces safety rules loaded from YAML config files.
Reads tool input JSON from stdin, evaluates all rule sets in a directory,
and outputs a single coalesced JSON decision to stdout.

Supports three tool inputs:
- Bash: matches against tool_input.command (target: bash rules)
- Write: matches against tool_input.content (target: file-content rules)
- Edit: matches against the full post-edit file content reconstructed from
  the on-disk file plus tool_input.old_string -> tool_input.new_string
  substitution (target: file-content rules)

Each decision is appended as a JSONL record to ~/.claude/claudewatch/decisions.jsonl
by default — the side channel the /ClaudeWatch:learn workflow reads. Set
CLAUDEWATCH_LOG to a path to log elsewhere, or to "off" (also 0/false/none/empty)
to disable it. Logging never affects the decision itself.

The ask-prompt reason reads `<rule>: <reason>`, where the reason prose is a
clickable OSC 8 terminal hyperlink to the rule's `ref` — so the verbose URL
stays out of the line. Set CLAUDEWATCH_HYPERLINKS to "off" (also
0/false/none/empty) to keep the plain `— <url>` form instead. Deny messages
always use the plain `— <url>` form: Claude Code renders them through its error
path, which strips OSC 8 without linking it. Deny messages also append the
`[plugin:ClaudeWatch]` source tag that Claude Code shows on ask prompts but
omits on deny errors. The logged reasons stay plain text regardless — no tag.
